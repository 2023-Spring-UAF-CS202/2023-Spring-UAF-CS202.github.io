# Object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that allows the programmer to:
  - define custom types (classes)
  - associate custom methods with the new type (methods)
  - control how the data in the object is initialized (constructors)
  - control how the data in the object is destroyed (destructors)

Most programming languages that support object-oriented programming include the first three items (class definitions, methods, and constructors. However, only some object-oriented programming languages include destructors. Examples of languages that do include C++ and Rust. 
 

## Examples of calling a method on an object in various languages

* Pseudo-smalltalk
```
    stdout printMessage “Hello World” withFormatting bold
```

* Pseudo-C++
```
    cout.printMessageWithFormatting(“Hello world, bold)

    “Hello world”.printWithFormatting(cout, bold)  
```
