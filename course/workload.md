#### Workload expectations

This class is a 3-credit hour undergraduate-level class. Following [University of Alaska Fairbanks policy](https://www.uaf.edu/uafgov/faculty-senate/curriculum/manual/Academic%20Course%20and%20Degree%20Procedures%20Manual%202022.pdf#page=40), this means that there will be **40 hours of instructional time** in class, and that you should expect to spend __*a minumum* of 80 hours outside of class__ on readings, study, coding practice, and homework over the course of the semester.

Learning to code well and think like a computer scientist can be an extremely rewarding experience. However, it takes commitment and effort and can sometimes be a challenging process. Do not underestimate the time that you will need to devote to succeed in this class.

You should expect to spend __*at least* 6 hours per week outside of class__ on readings, study, coding practice, and homework over the course of the semester. The estimate of 6 hours per week of work outside class is a minimum. *You should not be surprised if you may need to spend __significantly more time__ than that to achieve the course learning objectives and to master this material.*

In order for you to succeed in this class:

* You should carefully read all assigned texts prior to the assigned due date
* You should come talk with the instructor or the teaching assistant regularly during 1-on-1 student times
* You should spend a non-trivial amount of time each week practicing your coding skills (in addition to working on labs and homework assignments)
* You should diligently complete all assigned labs and homework assignments on time
