#### Late work

I expect you to turn in all homework assignments prior to the assigned due date.

Assignment submissions will be penalized by 10 percentage points each day past the deadline for four days past the deadline. Assignments submitted five or more days past the deadline will not be given credit. If there is an unforeseeable emergency which prevents you from submitting an assignment on time, please contact the instructor as soon as you can.

<ins>**Please note that files submitted erroneously, such as corrupted files, incomplete files, or files for another assignment will not be accepted, even if they are submitted before the deadline.**</ins> Only successfully submitted files will be graded. It is your responsibility to make sure to submit assignments early, regularly back up your work, and check your assignments after submission to ensure they have been submitted successfully. If you do run into an error with a submission, contact the instructor immediately.


For some or all homework assignments, a solution may be presented to the class after the original homework deadline. Under no circumstances will work be accepted after a solution has been presented to the class.
