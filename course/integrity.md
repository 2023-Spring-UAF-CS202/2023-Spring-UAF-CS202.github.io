#### Academic Integrity

As a student at UAF, you are expected to maintain high level of academic integrity. What does this mean?

The short answer is that you are expected to do your own work without copying from other students or from other sources. Copying the work of others or allowing others to copy your work is not acceptable.

The longer answer is that failure to maintain high levels of academic integrity can take many forms. Academic dishonesty applies to examinations, assignments, laboratory reports, fieldwork, practicums, creative projects, or other academic activities. Examples include, but are not limited to:

1. presenting as their own the ideas or works of others without proper citation of sources;
1. utilizing devices not authorized by the faculty member;
1. using sources (including but not limited to text, images, computer code, and audio/video files) not authorized by the faculty member;
1. providing assistance without the faculty member’s permission to another student, or receiving assistance not authorized by the faculty member from anyone (with or without their knowledge); 
1. submitting work done for academic credit in previous classes, without the knowledge and advance permission of the current faculty member;
1. acting as a substitute or utilizing a substitute;
1. deceiving faculty members or other representatives of the university to affect a grade or to gain admission to a program or course;
1. fabricating or misrepresenting data;
1. possessing, buying, selling, obtaining, or using a copy of any material intended to be used as an instrument of assessment in advance of its administration;
1. altering grade records of their own or another student’s work;
1. offering a monetary payment or other remuneration in exchange for a grade; or
1. violating the ethical guidelines or professional standards of a given program.

You are expected to carefully read the [Student code of conduct regarding Academic Misconduct](https://uaf.edu/csrr/student-conduct/academic-misconduct.php) at the UAF Center for Student Rights and Responsibilities. This should be done prior to the second class period of the semester.

Violations of academic integrity are not acceptable and will result in negative consequences. These consequences are listed in the policy linked above, and can be very serious, including a failing grade for the course.
