#### Disability Services

I will work with the Office of Disability Services to provide reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities. 

The Office of Disability Services implements the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and ensures that UAF students have equal access to the campus and course materials. I will work with the Office of Disabilities Services (208 Whitaker, 907-474-5655) to provide reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities uaf.edu/disability/

In order for me to support you by providing reasonable accomadation, I have to know that you need the accomadation. I can only do that if you let me know that an accomadation is needed.

If accomadation is needed, please work with the Office of Disability Services and let me know as early in the semester as possible. I ask that you please let me know about a need for accomadation by the end of the first week of class.
