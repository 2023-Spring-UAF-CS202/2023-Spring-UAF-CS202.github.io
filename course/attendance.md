#### Class attendance expectations

We will meet in person, but we will closely monitor the [UAF COVID-19 Dashboard](https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/coronavirus/uaf/dashboard?authuser=0). If conditions warrant, it is possible that classes could move to a fully online modality.

If you are sick or are experiencing any symptoms of illness (even mild symptoms) or if you may have been exposed to someone who is sick, I ask that you participate remotely. I will ensure that all course content is made fully available via live Zoom sessions and video recordings to students who are unable to attend class in person. I want you to succeed in this class. To that end, I very much appreciate your efforts in taking responsibilty for keeping all of us healthy.

I expect that you will attend class in-person unless you are sick or may have been exposed to someone who is sick.
