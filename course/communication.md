#### Communication

Clear communication is essential for success in this class.

The primary modes of communication in this class are:

* In-class communication
* Communication during 1-on-1 student meetings with the instructor and teaching assistant
* Communication through the course discussion forum on [CampusWire](http://campuswire.com)

You may of course use email to communicate with the instructor and teaching assistant, but we ask that you please use the forum on CampusWire if at all possible. Use of the forum makes it much easier for us to keep track of questions and to respond in a prompt manner.
