#### Instructional methods

This course is taught through a combination of lectures and guided lab activities.

During each class period, I will review previously taught material, present new material, and perform live programming during class. During each class period, you will complete a lab assignment to reinforce the topics covered.

There will be readings assigned from the textbook. This textbook was written by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of the C++ programming language, along with an expert in CS course design. I have selected this text and am requiring these readings because of the high quality of the content. I am assigning these readings because I believe that they will give you the best opportunity to successfully achieve the [course learning objectives](../learning). I expect that you will treat these readings as an important component of the course, and that you will carefully read all assigned readings prior to class.
