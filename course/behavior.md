#### Responsibilities in class

We all have a responsibility to foster a supportive learning environment in our classroom. Our responsibilities to each other include, but are not limited to:

Each of us (including the instructor) is expected to

* Attend class in person if you are well
* Attend class remotely if you are ill
* When attending class in person, you should be seated prior to the start of class
* When attending class remotely, you should ensure you have a stable internet connection, have your video turned on if at all possible, and have your microphone muted except when you are asking a question
* Turn off or completely silence your phone and put it in your backpack prior to the start of class
* Be well prepared for class
