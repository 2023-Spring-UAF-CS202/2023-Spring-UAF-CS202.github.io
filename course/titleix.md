#### Student Protection

UAF embraces and grows a culture of respect, diversity, inclusion, and caring. Students at this university are protected against sexual harassment and discrimination (Title IX). Faculty members are designated as responsible employees which means they are required to report sexual misconduct. Graduate teaching assistants do not share the same reporting obligations. For more information on your rights as a student and the resources available to you to resolve problems, please go to the following site: https://catalog.uaf.edu/academics-regulations/students-rights-responsibilities/.

University of Alaska Board of Regents have clearly stated in BOR Policy that discrimination, harassment and violence will not be tolerated on any campus of the University of Alaska. If you believe you are experiencing discrimination or any form of harassment including sexual harassment/misconduct/assault, you are encouraged to report that behavior. If you report to a faculty member or any university employee, they must notify the UAF Title IX Coordinator about the basic facts of the incident. 

Your choices for reporting include: 
You may access confidential counseling by contacting the UAF Health & Counseling Center at 907-474-7043; 
You may access support and file a Title IX report by contacting the UAF Title IX Coordinator at 907-474-6600; 
You may file a criminal complaint by contacting the University Police Department at 907-474-7721.  For more information please visit the UAF Department of Equity and Compliance webpage.

Any UAF employee or volunteer who reasonably suspects or observes minor abuse or maltreatment is required to report the incident. Reporting procedures are available on the UAF Protection of Minors. Violation of this policy by employees shall be reported as well.
